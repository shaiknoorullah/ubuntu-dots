# rofi-media.sh — Media playback controls via playerctl
#
# Description:
#   Displays a rofi dmenu with 5 media control actions (previous, play/pause,
#   next, shuffle, loop) using Nerd Font icons. The currently playing track's
#   artist and title are shown in rofi's message bar, giving quick "now playing"
#   feedback without needing a full media player window.
#
# Keybinding: $mod+m (defined in i3 config)
#
# Dependencies:
#   - rofi       : menu launcher (dmenu mode)
#   - playerctl  : MPRIS-compatible media player controller (works with
#                  Spotify, Firefox, VLC, mpd via playerctld, etc.)
#
# Usage:
#   ~/.config/rofi/scripts/rofi-media.sh
#
# Notes:
#   playerctl communicates with whichever MPRIS player is currently active.
#   If multiple players are running, playerctld determines priority. Stderr
#   is suppressed in get_track_info() so the menu still works when no
#   player is running — it just shows "Unknown - No Track".

# Path to the dedicated rofi theme for the media controls menu
THEME="$HOME/.config/rofi/themes/media.rasi"

# get_track_info — Retrieves the currently playing track's artist and title.
#
# Queries playerctl for MPRIS metadata. Stderr is redirected to /dev/null
# because playerctl exits non-zero when no player is running, and we want
# graceful fallback strings rather than error messages leaking into the menu.
#
# Parameters: none
#
# Returns (stdout):
#   A string in the format "Artist - Title", or fallback values if no
#   player is available (e.g. "Unknown - No Track").
get_track_info() {
    local artist title
    artist=$(playerctl metadata artist 2>/dev/null || echo "Unknown")
    title=$(playerctl metadata title 2>/dev/null || echo "No Track")
    echo "$artist - $title"
