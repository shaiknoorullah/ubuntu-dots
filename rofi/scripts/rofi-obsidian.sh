# rofi-obsidian.sh -- Obsidian Quick Actions Hub
#
# Description:
#   Central launcher for Obsidian vault operations. Presents a rofi menu
#   with four quick actions: create today's daily note (with YAML
#   frontmatter template), open the entire vault in VS Code, search
#   existing notes, or create a brand-new note. The search and create
#   actions delegate to dedicated companion scripts.
#
# Keybinding: $mod+n
#
# Dependencies:
#   - rofi        : menu/prompt interface
#   - code        : VS Code editor (used to open notes and the vault)
#   - notify-send : desktop notifications (used by sub-scripts)
#
# Related scripts:
#   - rofi-obsidian-search.sh : full-text note search (launched from here)
#   - rofi-obsidian-create.sh : new-note creation wizard (launched from here)
#
# Vault path: ~/powerhouse/
#
# Usage:
#   ~/.config/rofi/scripts/rofi-obsidian.sh
