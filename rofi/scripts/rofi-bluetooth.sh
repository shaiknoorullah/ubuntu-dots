# rofi-bluetooth.sh -- Bluetooth Device Manager
#
# Description:
#   Full-featured Bluetooth manager driven by rofi. The main menu lists all
#   paired devices (showing their connection status) and offers a scan option
#   for discovering new devices. Selecting a paired device opens a sub-menu
#   with context-sensitive actions (connect/disconnect, trust, remove). The
#   scan flow discovers nearby devices, then performs a pair + trust + connect
#   sequence on the user's selection.
#
# Keybinding: $mod+Shift+b
#
# Dependencies:
#   - rofi         : menu/prompt interface
#   - bluetoothctl : BlueZ command-line Bluetooth controller
#   - notify-send  : desktop notifications
#
# Usage:
#   ~/.config/rofi/scripts/rofi-bluetooth.sh
#
# Architecture:
#   main_menu()    -> top-level paired-device list + scan option
#   device_menu()  -> per-device action sub-menu (connect/disconnect/trust/remove)
#   Helper functions: power_on, get_paired_devices, get_device_mac, is_connected
#

THEME="$HOME/.config/rofi/themes/bluetooth.rasi"

# power_on()
#   Ensures the Bluetooth adapter is powered on before any operation.
#   Checks the current power state and, if off, sends the power-on command
#   and waits 1 second for the adapter to initialize. This avoids confusing
#   errors when the user has Bluetooth disabled.
#
#   Parameters: none
#   Returns:    nothing (side effect: adapter powered on)
power_on() {
    if bluetoothctl show | grep -q "Powered: no"; then
        bluetoothctl power on > /dev/null
        sleep 1

}

# get_paired_devices()
#   Retrieves the human-readable names of all paired Bluetooth devices.
#   The raw output of "bluetoothctl devices Paired" looks like:
#       Device AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF My Headphones
#   We strip the "Device" keyword and the MAC address, keeping only the name.
#
#   Parameters: none
#   Output:     one device name per line to stdout
get_paired_devices() {
    bluetoothctl devices Paired 2>/dev/null | awk '{$1=""; $2=""; print substr($0,3)}'
}

# get_device_mac()
#   Looks up the MAC address for a paired device given its display name.
#
#   Parameters:
#     $1 - Device name (as returned by get_paired_devices)
#
#   Output:
#     The MAC address (e.g., "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF") to stdout, or empty if
#     the device is not found.
get_device_mac() {

# is_connected()
#   Checks whether a device (identified by MAC) is currently connected.
#
#   Parameters:
#     $1 - MAC address of the device
#
#   Returns:
#     0 (true) if connected, 1 (false) otherwise

# main_menu()
#   Builds and displays the primary rofi menu. The menu always starts with
#   a "Scan for devices" entry, followed by each paired device annotated
#   with its connection status (an icon + optional "[connected]" tag).
#
#   Selecting "Scan" triggers a 5-second Bluetooth scan, then presents
#   discovered devices for pairing. Selecting a paired device delegates to
#   device_menu() for further actions.
