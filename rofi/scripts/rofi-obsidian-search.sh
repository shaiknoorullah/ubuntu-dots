# rofi-obsidian-search.sh -- Obsidian Note Search
#
# Description:
#   Finds every Markdown (.md) file inside the Obsidian vault and presents
#   them in a rofi menu as vault-relative paths (e.g., "daily/2025-01-15.md").
#   Rofi's built-in fuzzy matching lets the user quickly filter down to the
#   desired note, which is then opened in VS Code.
#
# Keybinding: $mod+Shift+n
#
# Dependencies:
#   - rofi        : menu/prompt interface (with built-in fuzzy filtering)
#   - find        : recursively discovers .md files in the vault
#   - code        : VS Code editor
#   - notify-send : desktop notifications for errors/empty states
#
# Vault path: ~/powerhouse/
#
# Usage:
#   ~/.config/rofi/scripts/rofi-obsidian-search.sh
#   (Also launched from rofi-obsidian.sh "Search Notes" action)
#

# -printf "%P\n" strips the leading $VAULT_DIR prefix so paths are clean
